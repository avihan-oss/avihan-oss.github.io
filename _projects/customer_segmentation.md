## Project Overview
In this project, I engineered a clustering model to identify distinct customer groups from a large-scale dataset. The goal was to uncover hidden patterns in consumer behavior to enable targeted marketing strategies.

### Technical Approach
* **Algorithms**: Utilized **K-Means Clustering** and **Hierarchical Clustering** to categorize data based on purchasing behavior.
* **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applied **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** to reduce feature space and visualize high-dimensional data in 2D/3D.
* **Tools**: Built using **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.

### Key Results
* **Cluster Identification**: Successfully segmented the dataset into distinct behavioral groups (e.g., "High Spenders," "Budget Conscious").
* **Visualization**: Produced clear visualizations of customer distribution, aiding in the interpretation of spending habits and income correlations.
* **Impact**: Provided actionable insights that can drive personalized marketing campaigns.
