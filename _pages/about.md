I am a 3rd-year **Mathematics** student at [IISER Thiruvananthapuram](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/), specializing in **Computational Mathematics** and **Machine Learning**.

My work focuses on **Research Engineering**—taking theoretical models (like Game Theory and Differential Equations) and implementing them into scalable code.

Currently, I am working on:
* **Game Theory:** Solving Nash Equilibrium in coalition games.
* **Computer Vision:** Malaria parasite detection using CNNs.
* **Data Science:** Customer segmentation using clustering algorithms.
